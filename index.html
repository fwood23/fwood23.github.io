<p>Today in ILab we got to try out Virtual Reality Technology which was really cool! In the Virry Safari I chose to explore elephants. Because of the view of the camera the elephants are HUGE. The first elephant I saw was really tall and then it turned out to be a child and the Mother was even bigger! It was weird but amazing. We also got to paint in Vr. Although the VR paint controls took some time to get used to, drawing in 3d is really cool!  My only complaint is that sometimes when I wanted to add a line to a drawing it would be in front of where I wanted it to be because it was 3d.  It’s really cool and definitely has some advantages to normal drawing. For example, enabling someone to create 3d drawings and models instead of having to draw “fake” 3d. I did all this stuff with the oculus and next I got to try the Samsung gear. With this I watched a video about an ancient Egyptian temple and even though the gear wasn’t as immersive as the oculus it was pretty cool. After that we got to use 360 cameras which are cool.
I would say the advantages of using a 360 camera would be that someone could show another person around without taking multiple pictures. But right now, because there so expensive it’s easier to just take multiple pictures. Out of the three we used the gear, google cardboard, and oculus. I would say oculus is the best because it’s much more immersive especially because you use your hands which allows for a more real feeling. Even though it could seem to some people as an entertainment system VR could change the world for the better including doing things like transporting kids who can’t access school to a virtual school. It’s also been shown that VR can be used to work to “cure” PTSD.
